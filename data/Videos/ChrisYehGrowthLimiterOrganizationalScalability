This is a transcript by Chris Yeh, titled "Growth Limiter 2: Organizational Scalability"

Chris Yeh: The other side of it is organizational scalability. If you require people in order to run your company, then you have to figure out a way to scale up your people infrastructure just like you're scaling up your technology infrastructure. Ideally, you have a business where the people scales at a lower rate than the revenues and customers scale. Otherwise, you're going to be in big trouble. But even if you do need to scale up your people, that is not a light challenge. You still have to figure out how to organize your company in a way that you're able to grow, and so being situated in a place where you have access to the talent you need to grow or figure out an organizational structure where you're going to be able to bring other people on, possibly even use a community to help you out, that's going to help you with the organizational scalability. Again, these things are not things that are going to necessarily cause your company to be successful, but a lack of scalability could cause your blitzscaling effort to fail.
