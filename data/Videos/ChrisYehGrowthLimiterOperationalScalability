This is a transcript of a lecture by Chris Yeh titled "Growth Limiter 3: Operational Scalability"

Chris Yeh: Another key growth limiter for Blitzscaling is the concept of operational scalability. Now, operational scalability is simply the ability to grow your company in a relatively smooth way to take advantage of the demand that you have achieved in the marketplace. And this comes in two different forms. The first form is operational scalability, just straight up operations, the technology, the infrastructure, all the assembly lines, whatever it takes in order to serve your customers. That operational scalability is something you have to figure out how to use. There are plenty of companies that have been able to do everything else but failed on this operational scalability. A classic example is Friendster, the first mainstream social network. Social networks are some of the most blitz scalable business models imaginable. And companies like Facebook and LinkedIn have demonstrated that the rewards of building a successful social network are almost incalculable. However, Friendster was the first successful mainstream social network, but it failed because it could not manage its operational scalability. 
It made a set of technical choices that meant that as it grew, its webpages grew slower and slower. By the time that Facebook and MySpace and other companies like that started coming around, Friendster had gotten to the point where its pages took a minute to load. Clearly no one is going to adopt that kind of a social network. And despite its early lead and raising a large amount of money from plantar Perkins and other famous investors, Friendster eventually went under and was acquired and really did not live up to its early promise. Do not let this happen to you. Figure out your operational scalability.
