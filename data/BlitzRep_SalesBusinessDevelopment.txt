Sales & Business Development
Family
* During the Household phase, the default approach to partnerships and business development for most companies should be to avoid them like the plague. The sad fact is that large organizations don’t know how to interface well with small companies. Big companies are slow, unresponsive, and their incentives rarely align with those of their partners.The confusing thing is that it is a good idea to “partner” with the major platform companies. This is simply a misuse of the term; when leverage an Amazon, Google, or Microsoft platform, you’re a customer, not a partner, even if you’re an “official partner.”There are rare exceptions when your small company should pursue partnerships and business development: A) The only way to build the business is with a partnership (even if it risks destroying the organization); B) One of the founders has a special relationship with a player in the larger organization—either the CEO, Founder, or other key executive who has the power and responsibility to go outside the usual corporate processes to effectively work with a small company. These rare partnerships can be hugely valuable for the smaller company—think of IBM’s partnership with Microsoft that made MS-DOS the operative system for the IBM PC, or Netscape’s partnership with Yahoo to make Yahoo the default search engine for Netscape users. But if you don’t already have this kind of relationship, don’t seek it out. The probability of such a relationship working out is as close to zero as you can find in the uncertain world of startups.Given these issues, the only business development person you should have (if you have one) is a founder, or a generalist who takes on the role on a very part-time basis.
* At the outset, the founders do the selling. Your main objective is to maximize learning, not revenue, which means you need to stay close to the sales and service process. The sales process is less about deals (though those are good) and more about intensive, ad hoc product and service feedback. You can’t get hung up on making sales predictable; you’re just trying to define how sales work. Heck, at this stage you frequently don’t even know what your business model will be.This need to stay close to sales one of the reasons why selling is one of the fundamental skills that founders need to develop. In a few rare exceptions, you might have a non-founder doing some sales, but even these exceptions are not “salespeople”; rather, they are flexible generalists who tackle some sales activities as one of many responsibilities. Professional salespeople might be good at selling X, but you might be selling Y in two weeks.During the early days of LinkedIn, we covered three different business models in the Series B pitch deck: selling to professionals, selling placements in search results, and job listing fees. The deck didn’t even mention what turned out to be LinkedIn’s key business model of selling to recruiting professionals. Of course, even that might change in the future.


Tribe
* As your company grows, you can no longer completely ignore the function. You will get inbound inquiries, and you will want to (very selectively) start some conversations. Even though you’re not likely to do a deal at this phase, you want to start building the trust and interest for when you want to get to a deal.At most, you should start between 0 to 2 conversations. The general message to convey is, “We’re making sure that you know about us.” Opening a channel of communication helps establish trust, credibility, and familiarity. You might not even want to reach a deal; given the rapid pace of your company’s growth, you should probably wait until you’ve made maximum progress before locking in terms. The same is true of inbound inquiries; if you gruffly dismiss them, you’re squelching trust before it can take root. Better to be clear that you don’t have a lot of time for partnership, but are willing to spend a few cycles to begin establishing the relationship.The overall approach is still to minimize the time you spend on this so that you can focus on other tasks that are necessary to move the company forward..Here is where it can be useful to have one or two generalists who can field these calls. A smart generalist can establish a lightweight, friendly relationship with a potential partner, allowing the founder to focus on advancing the product. At LinkedIn, both Lee Hower and Matt Cohler played this role to keep the founders from wasting time on these discussions.The temptation is to treat partnership inquiries as validation. This is a potentially fatal mistake. It might feel good to tell others that you’re talking about partnerships with X, Y, and Z leading firms, but the chances of reaching a deal are still infinitesimal.For example, in the early days of LinkedIn, we received a partnership inquiry from American Express. This is a classic trap for a blitzscaling company. It seemed like it could be a great opportunity—after all, both companies targeted business professionals. But we knew that large company/small company partnerships don’t usually work. Our strategy was to pursue a lightweight partnership which we thought would likely not work.Sadly, we were correct, despite AMEX’s sincere efforts. For example, AMEX allocated a $1 million budget for a marketing campaign to get 40,000 AMEX OPEN members to sign up for LinkedIn. We were flabbergasted, and offered to take the $1 million as a bounty for achieving their goal. But because AMEX had a close relationship with their advertising agency, our far better deal was politically infeasible for AMEX. AMEX spent the $1 million and got far fewer than the target of 40,000 signups. In retrospect, we probably should have said no, but by keeping the partnership tightly focused and contained, the fallout wasn’t too damaging. And this was a best case scenario of where we had a partnership with premier player who made a million-dollar commitment, and which went out of its way to be a good partner!
* When you reach the tribal phase, you’ll need to start hiring dedicated salespeople. This doesn’t mean hiring a sales executive; this is a common mistake that technical founders make. They assume that the right strategy is to hire a VP of Sales who will then build out a team. The problem is that sales and sales management are two completely different disciplines. Instead, hire a salesperson who is willing to be the first person to land on the beach. Rather than optimizing for efficiency, optimize for flexibility—you should try to hire a Swiss Army knife, rather than a scalpel. Don’t worry about hiring someone to “build the team” until you’ve established a beachhead in the market. 


Village
* As you scale up, you will probably need to establish a business development group. The nature of that group will depend on the relative importance of partnerships to your business.If business development is a big differentiator in your business, it should be a Founder role, and you should hire experienced, professional BD people to support the founders.If business development is moderately important to the business, you should hire one or more partnership people, who can act as the interface point for partners, thus freeing up the founders. These partnership people are mainly tactical and transactional.If business development is unimportant to the business, but you still need to respond to inquiries, you should have one person who serves as the interface point. This person is probably a generalist who does other things as well.
* As the company scales, you now need to build a true sales organization. You might need to organize multiple sales teams to cover different geographies and product lines. It’s at this point that you should hire a true sales executive, who has experience managing a growing organization. Hopefully this hire will be able to scale up to the next phase as well.The key skill of the sales executive is process management. By now, the sales pipeline is large enough that the team will need a systematic process for nurturing leads and forecasting deals.


City
* You have to start building partnership competence, even if it didn’t matter before. You’re at a scale where you have to work with others, and you should have a competent partnership person (even if they aren’t part of the executive team). If you don’t, you’re underplaying your hand. If business development is a big differentiator in your business, you should have a head of business development who is part of the executive team and leads a hard-charging, multi-person group.
* As the firm achieves massive scale, sales predictability becomes crucial. Your company might be publicly-traded, in which case your quarterly sales figures and forward-looking projections will be scrutinized like a papal decree. Your finance team will also need sales predictability to effectively manage cash flow and financing activities.Sales can also be a source of competitive advantage in non-monetary ways. As a default, Sales tends to focus on short-term financial results, as exemplified in the old adage, “The customer is always right.” Unfortunately, the customer isn’t generally very good at projecting his or her future needs and behavior. This short-term focus can actually be at odds with the product strategy. At LinkedIn, Mike Gamson built a great sales organization that understood and complemented the long-term product strategy, rather than fighting with it. 


Nation
* Partnerships are important to any company that reaches this stage. Even if you’re not partnering “up” (there might not be that many companies that are bigger than yours!), you need to partner with the ecosystem that has grown up around you.If your world-changing company doesn’t have a professional partnerships and business development group, it’s the equivalent of trying to run a nation without a diplomatic corps.
