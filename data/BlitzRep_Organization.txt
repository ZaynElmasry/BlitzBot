All Stages


* At this point, almost everyone in the startup world agrees that hiring and culture are important. Whenever these topics arise, it’s almost guaranteed that the discussion will touch on how every Google employee had to interview with Larry and Sergey before receiving an offer, how Zappos offers new employees $1,000 to quit to weed out those who aren’t true believers, and how uber-guru Peter Drucker said, “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” These are inspiring stories and sound bites, but what they fail to do is to explain why hiring and culture are so important, and how to manage them as your startup scales.As with other key activities, a blitzscaling company has to repeatedly change its approach to hiring and culture. As you grow, everything from how you find job candidates to what kinds of employees you hire will have to change. In this environment of constant change—both in personnel and organizational structure—you need to develop a coherent culture that is a North Star that the organization and its members can rely on to help guide their actions. Hiring and culture go hand in hand because the primary driver of an organization’s culture is the additive effect of the people it hires, while one of the primary tools to help the organization hire and get the most out of the necessary people is the allure and disciplinary effect of a strong culture.A coherent culture needs to be specific, rather than simply an accumulation of agreeable platitudes. For example, Steve Jobs famously said, “A players like to work only with other A players, which means you can’t indulge B players.” It’s a great sound bite, but saying that your company has a high-performance culture of “A” players doesn’t provide enough useful differentiation. What is an “A” player? Someone who went to the right schools? Worked at the right companies? Can code 10x faster than the average developer? Your culture should attract the talent you want and repel the talent you don’t want. It is better to be loved by a few than liked by a multitude. If your culture doesn’t rule out “A” players who aren’t a good fit, it’s not specific enough.For example, the two companies I helped start, PayPal and LinkedIn, both had coherent cultures, but were radically different from each other. PayPal was very individualistic, with a lot of emphasis on hiring for high IQ and very little on emphasis on hiring for work experience. The company tempo had a frantic pace that tended to be driven by what I’d characterize as “structured panic.” In contrast, LinkedIn’s culture was far more collaborative and patient. We felt that we were seeing something that others didn’t (specifically, the value of a professional social network), and understood that it would take a long time for the world to come around. This meant that we needed to be patient and take multiple shots on goal, while remaining confident that we would eventually succeed. People that fit the PayPal culture tended not to fit the LinkedIn culture, and vice versa.To build your culture, you have to make tradeoffs. For example, do you want your culture to be individualistic or collaborative? Do you prioritize efficiency or innovation? Even characteristics that seem to be universal require thought and specificity. Most companies claim to be mission-driven, but there’s a world of difference between being seriously mission-driven (any decision that touches on the mission is a clear, black-and-white decision) or only lightly mission-driven (the mission is one of many factors considered).It’s also important to note that “bad” cultures can sometimes produce good companies. When it comes to culture, employees ask themselves, “All other things being equal, do I want to keep working here?” The thing is, in most cases, all other things aren’t equal. Many talented people will tolerate a bad culture (i.e. work in an environment in which they’d rather not work) to be part of a winning team. There is actually a long history of successful blitzscaling companies with aggressive, demanding cultures that burn out employees, break up their marriages, and discard them when no longer useful. Within Silicon Valley, companies like Oracle, Zynga, Uber, and yes, PayPal have been criticized for their culture, as have companies outside the Valley like Microsoft and Amazon. Those same companies have also defined new industries and created over a trillion dollars in shareholder value. At PayPal, we had a culture that was both good and bad. On the good side, we were young, aggressive, and intellectually honest. On the bad side, we were intolerant of compromise, dictatorial, dismissive of banking experience, and allowed pointed conflict between executives. Just in the year 2000, we had four different CEOs: Peter Thiel, Bill Harris, Elon Musk, and then Peter Thiel again. But because we got our business model right, we were successful.Culture is not destiny. It does, however, shape the environment you will be working in for years or decades to come, so choose wisely.Of course, your culture will continue to evolve as your company grows—it is a living set of principles, not a set of stone tablets—but radical changes should be avoided unless they are required to meet an existential threat to the organization.
* For most of Silicon Valley’s history, the conventional wisdom on hiring executives into a startup was to bring in an executive who could scale. This meant hiring someone who had experience with bigger organizations, even if the hire was one or two phases early.In today’s startup world, this rule no longer applies. The Darwinian competition is so fierce that your organization needs to be “all in” on the current stage of scaling. You need executives who can manage the current phase of growth, because you won’t have to worry about that next phase if your team can’t actually get you there. Hiring someone who has been managing 1,000 people to contribute to a 10-person company is actually counterproductive, because the skills needed to succeed during those two phases are very different.The ideal, of course, is to hire executives who can excel at your current phase, and can stretch to cover the next phase as well. But that “scalability” is a secondary concern. The primary concern is current value. You can worry about whether to scale or replace an individual executive when the company approaches its next phase.People who can transition from world-class individual talent to world-class executive are even rarer than “unicorns”—billion-dollar startups.The terms “manager” and “executive” are often used interchangeably. We believe that managers and executives play very different roles. Most of the confusion probably comes from the tendency in early-stage startups for the same person to play the role of manager and executive. These are separate roles, even when the same person plays them.The role of the Manager is to lead a tribe on a hunting expedition; managers are frontline leaders who worry about day to day tactics. Managers create and implement detailed execution plans that either allow the organization to do new things, or do existing things more efficiently.In contrast, the role of the Executive is to lead Managers and their organizations. For the most part, executives don’t manage individual contributors. Instead, they focus on vision and strategy. Yet they are still connected to the frontline employees because they are also responsible for the “fighting spirit” of their organizations; they need to be role models who help people persist through inevitable adversity. Both Executives and Managers are necessary for successful blitzscaling.
* Hiring the people you need to scale isn’t enough; a good onboarding process helps you get more out of those people, and improves their work experience and boosts your chances of retaining them.
* One of the areas which undergoes the most change during the blitzscaling process is the internal communications process. You have to shift from informal, in-person, individual conversations to formal, electronic, “push” broadcasting, and online “pull” resources. You also have to shift from sharing all information by default to deciding on what is secret and what is shareable. If you don’t manage to develop an effective internal communications strategy, your organization will become disjointed and start to fall apart.
* The current wisdom of Silicon Valley is that founders should remain CEO. Previously, founders were the specialists, the pioneers who would create, but not grow the company. The founder was the visionary, you brought in “grey haired” professional management to be the CEO.Today, many believe that the founder is the only one who has the moral authority and fortitude to lead.Both of these approaches have some good thinking in them, but both also have key limitations.The limitation of the old school approach of bringing in an outside CEO is that if that CEO doesn’t have the right skillset and visionary mentality (product-oriented, risk-taking, long-term committed), the company won’t be able to adapt to new technologies and markets, and probably won’t stay a world-changing company. The limitation of the new school of founder CEOs is that if the CEO doesn’t have the pragmatic management skills to navigate the rapid scale changes along the way, the company will get hung up on internal organizational issues long before it becomes a world-changing company. It’s simplest to find founders who have the combination of skills to scale all the way, but this is seldom possible. Nor is it true that the only path to success is a founder who stays CEO forever—most of LinkedIn’s success came after I managed a successful succession process that saw Jeff Weiner take over as CEO. Some folks in SV think that the moment the founder isn’t CEO, the company starts dying. But if you truly believe this, you limit the lifespan of important companies that generate innovation and jobs. One of Steve Jobs’ greatest accomplishments, in a career filled with amazing achievements, was transitioning the office of Apple CEO to Tim Cook. Thanks to both Steve and Tim, Apple has been able to overcome Steve’s untimely passing and become the world’s most profitable and valuable company. It’s important to note that Cook didn’t replace Jobs—an impossible task. Tim has been a very different kind of CEO than Steve, but has found his own way to succeed at his job, including breaking with Steve’s tradition of handling all of Apple’s major product announcements and ceding some of the responsibility for those product demos to other executives.The general way to solve this problem is to look for a combination of scaling skills and moral authority and commitment. You’d prefer to grow the founders, because this is the guaranteed way to solve the issues of moral authority and commitment. However, if your founding CEO and other founders are capable of being collaborative, they can bring in what are essentially new “co-founders,” which gives you a path to ask, “What is the best possible way to grow this company?”The right time to execute CEO succession plans is *before* your next blitzscaling phase. At each phase transition, you are likely to change your executive staff by 50% or more; each transition thus represents a chance to A) bring in a CEO, and B) give that CEO the opportunity to build the team that she believes can navigate that scale.Each CEO succession is a massive risk—will the CEO have the right skills? Can she develop the moral authority? Will the organization accept her? The chances of success are probably 50% or less. (The chances are higher if you’re just looking for a caretaker, but that’s not what blitzscaling companies look for) This is also why the founders need to stick around, to help the company recover if the risk doesn’t pay off. With Jeff Weiner, we had grown to like each other, but hadn’t worked together before. If it didn’t work out, I needed to stay close enough to the business to monitor the organization’s reaction to the transition, and make an adjustment if necessary. Fortunately, Jeff turned out to be a great fit for LinkedIn, and was even named CEO of the Year by Glassdoor.If you’re a Founder-CEO, you need to examine your skillset and compare it to the skillset the company will need to successful manage the next stage of blitzscaling. When your company grows from a Tribe into a Village, the CEO will need to shift from working directly with individual contributors to selecting and managing an executive team (in the true sense of the term, i.e. a team that executes). Ask yourself, “Is my skillset suited to scaling and leading executives, or is it better suited to detailed product work or long-term strategy?” When I decided to bring in a CEO for LinkedIn, I asked that very question. Ultimately, while I greatly respect and appreciate the work of building an organization, it’s not the work I like to do. And if you don’t like what you do, you’re not likely to be world class at it.Of course, as the founder, you do what is necessary. If you can’t find the right CEO to take over, you may have to go outside your comfort zone and tackle tasks that aren’t in your wheelhouse, but are critical to the success of the company.Internal and external CEO candidates have different pros and cons; which you ought to prefer will depend on the specific circumstances. On the one hand, you might prefer internal candidates because they know the company and how it operates, are clearly committed to the company. Internal candidates are generally lower risk.On the other hand, internal candidates are deeply embedded in the game as it is played already. Furthermore, because the internal candidate is part of a team of peers, it will probably be harder for the new CEO to reset those peer relationships into reporting relationships, and the executives who weren’t chosen will probably be at a greater risk of leaving.As a result of these factors, you tend to go internal when you’re playing the same game, and you tend to go external when you’re trying to change the game. 
* Many entrepreneurs view the Board of Directors as a nuisance. They complain about having to waste time preparing for board meetings and responding to board requests. These entrepreneurs are dead wrong.While corporate governance may not seem like a big deal during the early stages of blitzscaling, the role of the Board of Directors is critical at scale, especially in providing connections to other key network nodes.In mature scaleup ecosystems like Silicon Valley, there exists a robust set of experienced, high-quality VCs. An ecosystem doesn’t need that many VCs; quality is more important than quantity. Boulder, Colorado is a small ecosystem without many investors, but the venture capitalists of the Foundry Group allow Boulder entrepreneurs to tap a deep set of experiences and networks.Boards are important connectors into the relevant networks that can help your company realize its opportunities and counteract its threats. Great venture capitalists can leverage their connectivity to accelerate a blitzscaling company’s access to financing, talent, and customers. Investors ought to be key partners and collaborators on fundraising strategy. They can also help recruit the talent you need, either informally (Benchmark recruiting Meg Whitman to eBay) or formally (venture capital firms like Greylock Partners, Kleiner Perkins, and Andreesen Horowitz have partners who focus solely on talent, including individual contributors in product/design/engineering as well as classic executive recruiting.) Established VCs have strong relationships with potential customers (for enterprise companies) or distribution partners (for consumer companies) thanks to their past portfolio companies.Regardless of phase, there are some key best practices for Board management. First, outside board members should be brought for a specific term, not indefinitely. You can always ask board members to serve another term, and this practice helps ensure that you have a clear reason for each board member to be there. Specific terms also provide opportunities to change board composition without having to ask board members to proactively resign.Second, you should have a clear idea of how each board member can add value, both individually, and more importantly, as part of the team. Far too many board members are selected for their brand value. A board of directors is a team, not a collection of “all-stars”. Hustle is a critical virtue. A world-famous CEO may look great on an annual report, but she may not have the time to be much help in scaling and running the business. 
* Founders play a special role in every company. Think of the importance of America’s “Founding Fathers”, nearly 250 years later. Founders are the only people in the organization who can and should be counted on to consistently place the needs of the organization ahead of their own. While founders may have an official job title and position within the org chart, being a founder comes with its own privileges, responsibilities, and potential pitfalls, and these keep changing as the startup scales up.On the other hand, we have to be careful to avoid falling prey to the cult of the founder. People often view legendary founders as semi-divine beings with powers beyond those of mortal men and women. This kind of apotheosis does more harm than good by discouraging entrepreneurship from those who lack a megalomaniacal worldview and encouraging those entrepreneurs who do view themselves as the next Steve Jobs to adopt a similarly autocratic approach. Founders succeed because they have the right skills and the right team around them to start and scale the right company at the right time in the right market.Fit—and luck—are essential. No one is a “universal” founder that can succeed at anything. Steve Jobs’ perfectionism probably wouldn’t work well for someone starting a fast food chain. That perfectionism works for a high-talent workforce building a high-value product (elegant computers, award-winning animated movies), would not work well for enforcing the cost discipline needed for delivering a low-priced commodity.There are some universal skills that all founders need to succeed. You need the ability to take bold risks in pursuit of a vision that isn’t self-evident to others. You need the ability to learn (since you’re trying to do something brand new. And to play a long-term role at your scaleup, you need the ability to live with and resolve the inevitable paradoxes of being a founder. Maintaining a certain humility and a sense of perspective can help you navigate the changes in your role as your blitzscale your company. 
* Entire libraries have been written about the role of the CEO. Rather than recapitulating those other works, in this book, we wiell restrict our focus to the two key roles of the CEO in a blitzscaling organization.The first key role is to decide which key people the organization will need to grow, and to execute on a plan to bring those people into the fold. Of course, this is easier said than done.One common mistake is to design the perfect organization, and then slot your people in using a “best fit” algorithm. This can result in trying to force square pegs into round holes. I know, because this is precisely the mistake I made as an inexperienced entrepreneur. Rather than adhering to a Platonic ideal, the specific people you already have (and their talents and passions) should influence the structure you define.You also need to consider the nature of your business; for example, Consumer Internet companies tend to make Engineering and Operations part of the same organizational group. This makes sense because the rapid product changes that Engineering releases directly impacts Operations; similarly, Operational concerns need to be baked into Engineering plans because a poorly performing site or app can be fatal to the company. Balancing the structural needs of the organization and the specific talents of the individuals is an art, not a science!Another common mistake is hiring people too far in advance. We’re not talking about hiring too many people too quickly, though this too is a problem. Rather, we’re referring to hiring people who are better suited to later phases of growth. The marketing executive who knows how to handle a $25 million budget for a 1,000-person company probably doesn’t have the right skills to help your bootstrapping garage startup get its initial product launch noticed. Fit matters just as much as raw talent. We’ll discuss the topic further when we cover Hiring and Culture later on.Finally, CEOs should avoid succumbing to the temptation of using the founders to fill in the organizational gaps. While it is certainly useful for founders to act as “chief cook and bottle washer,” and do whatever needs to be done, using the founders to plug holes is only effective as a short-term strategy. Long term, the CEO needs to hire leaders who can build the organization in a sustainable, scalable fashion.The second key role of the CEO is to embody and lead the organization’s strategy. This doesn’t mean that he or she has to take sole responsibility for generating that strategy. The best ideas should win, regardless of origin. But it does mean that the CEO has to know the strategy inside and out, and have the experience and skills to execute on that strategy. [EXAMPLE: E.G. IF YOU ASKED JEFF WEINER ABOUT X, HE’D SAY….]At LinkedIn, I hired Dan Nye, a well-respected and capable enterprise executive as CEO. Dan did a great job of building our organization and bringing good people on board. But I eventually realized that LinkedIn was not an Enterprise Software company. Rather, we were a Consumer Internet company that had an Enterprise Software company inside it. Even though Enterprise customers generated the bulk of our revenue, the consumer experience was the defining bellwether. That’s why I stepped back in as CEO, and why I then chose Jeff Weiner to run LinkedIn.Jeff’s Consumer Internet experience at Yahoo, where he managed 3,000 people and oversaw most of Yahoo’s key consumer-facing products like Mail, Search, and the Front Page, allowed him to embody and drive our strategy. One of the ways he won over our team was when the Operations team discovered that Jeff was one of the most active users of LinkedIn.com—globally, not just among senior managers. CEOs need to make hard decisions. When complex issues arise, your people, no matter how brilliant, will have different views of what’s important and what isn’t. And even if they are perfectly aligned with and focused on the best interests of the company, they will naturally disagree. As a result, the harder the decision, the more likely it is that the CEO will have to decide what really matters, and what to do about it. A CEO who doesn’t embody the strategy won’t be able to make the right calls.In the past, I’ve written about how I consider Jeff a co-founder of LinkedIn, even though he joined us over five years after the company was first formed. I believe that companies can have multiple inflection points that serve as founding moments, and you can be a co-founder if you play a critical role at one of those moments. To be a true co-founder, the incoming CEO needs to develop a good interface with the existing co-founders. These are the people who are known to be “all in” on the company’s mission; if they accept the new CEO as someone who is as “all in” as they, that acceptance conveys moral authority. (We cover this topic in greater detail in the previous chapter, The Role of the Founders)One final thing you should keep in mind is that there is no such thing as a universal CEO. “We’ll just hire someone from GE” often doesn’t work. Hiring the CEO as a GM with general “management” skills doesn’t work; the CEO has to have a firm grasp on the key drivers of success (product, technology, user experience (UX), customer demand) because speed is essential and without good instincts, you simply can’t act quickly enough.You can see this principle at work in when you consider how the background of the typical blitzscaling CEO has shifted over time. Earlier in the history of Silicon Valley, the biggest challenge that a scaleup faced was building out an effective distribution strategy. Growth required highly disciplined execution of sales and channel management. As a result, many companies tapped sales executives with proven go-to-market expertise to be CEO.In today’s world, product *is* distribution. Mobile app stores and freemium SaaS have supplanted shrink-wrapped software and resellers as the main way of reaching the customer. Thanks to the consumerization of IT, even enterprise software relies on seemingly consumer distribution strategies such as engineering virality into the product. And when customers choose the products, rather than relying on middlemen and intermediaries, building a killer product is more important than enlisting killer distribution partners. As a result, companies are far more likely to name CEOs with a track record of releasing killer products. At Microsoft, Steve Ballmer (a classic sales-oriented CEO) was succeeded by Satya Nadella (a modern product-oriented CEO).
* The challenge that faces the founders, executives, and investors of a blitzscaling company is that the nature of the leadership required to succeed changes dramatically as the company scales up. The simplistic silver bullet approach of “hire the right people” glosses over a key fact: Very few people are great leaders at every phase from garage to global giant. A blitzscaling organization can scale exponentially, year after year. Most humans can’t do that; our scaling is generally linear at best, and may be too slow to keep up with the organization. We estimate that at any given phase, fewer than half of your executives can scale beyond their current roles.As you prepare to scale up the organization, you have to ask yourself two questions about your key people:• Can they scale?• Do they believe they can scale?Based on the answers, each of your people can be placed into one of four quadrants of a two by two matrix: Believes can’t scaleBelieves can scaleCan scaleProvide coaching to improve confidence and unlock potentialCongratulations, no need to do anything!Can’t scaleTry to find a new role that will be a better fit at the next stageTime for a difficult conversation When people can’t scale, the role of the leader is to find a replacement who can, and to try to find a new role that will be a better fit for the existing employee. Even if you don’t succeed, and the employee ends up leaving, the fact that the organization tried will become a part of its talent brand.Even those people are who are capable of “scaling” with the company will be best suited to one particular stage. Yet a scaleup can’t just hire a new leadership team each time it grows significantly. You don’t want to lose the continuity, experience, and hard-won expertise.Instead of a single silver bullet, you need to blend a variety of approaches, including growing and developing the talent you already have in the organization, recruiting new talent with relevant blitzscaling skills, and successfully incorporating both elements into a coherent, effective organization and culture. Much of the responsibility for recruiting and developing talent belongs to your firm’s individual managers. We discuss our recommended talent management philosophy in depth in our previous book, The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age. By structuring work as series of “tours of duty,” you can acknowledge the reality that few employees will stay with one company their entire career. If the company scales beyond an employee’s abilities or comfort zone, you should still celebrate the successes they had, and maintain an alliance of mutual trust and benefit even after they have moved on to another company. If you or your managers need a pragmatic, concrete guide on how to recruit and develop your talent, we recommend reading The Alliance. You can find an executive summary of the book on its website, www.theallianceframework.com.In the following section of this book, we’ll focus on higher-level people processes and strategy, including internal communications, transparency, coordination, and other elements of your organization that will change during the blitzscaling process.

* "During this phase, the founders *are* the company. Their role is simple: To do whatever is necessary to assemble the resources the company needs to go from zero to one. This includes their own specific skills and experiences.In the ideal scenario, the founding team already has all the necessary capabilities to launch the company, from the technical ability to build a prototype, the product chops to define a minimum viable product, and the sales and marketing skills to start telling and selling. This is one of the reasons why solo founders are often considered a red flag by investors—it is nearly impossible for one man or woman to meet all those requirements at a world-class level.Yet the world is seldom ideal, which means that one of the key roles of the founders is to draw upon their personal networks to a) fake it as best they can, and b) get help from people with complementary skills. These could be spouses, old friends, relatives—people who believe in the founders enough to contribute without much expectation of reward. This usually doesn’t mean hiring people; at this phase, you probably can’t convince anyone good enough to come on full time. Assembling the relevant networks around the company is probably the only way to get the capital, talent, customers, and advice needed to scale.The question we like to ask is, “Who are the people without whom you wouldn’t start this company?” If someone doesn’t make that list, he or she shouldn’t be a founder. This doesn’t mean that all the founders are equal, but it does mean that they are all necessary.At this phase, it’s also critical to make sure that the founders are fully committed. Losing a founder at this stage is usually fatal to the business. It simply doesn’t have the margin of safety to survive such a blow. (Note that as the founding team is forming, it’s not uncommon for someone who was originally “in” to decide to opt out; this isn’t the same as losing a founder once the startup effort is truly underway. It’s an annulment, not a divorce.) The founders should be able to collectively say, “We will stay with this startup as long as we can still help the business launch a successful product and become an ongoing institution.” This is what we termed a Foundational Tour of Duty in our previous book, The Alliance. A Foundational Tour of Duty occurs when a company and an individual both agree that the individual is a permanent part of the organization. These Foundational individuals provide continuity and institutional memory, and are also key standard-bearers for the company culture. In the early phases, these Foundational employees are the founders, but as the company grows, other key member of the team can achieve this status.If, in a later Phase, the business no longer needs a particular founder, you should try to find a different role in which the founder can still contribute, but you should also respect that founder’s decision if he or she wants to move on. At Twitter, for example, founders like Ev Williams and Biz Stone are busy working on new projects like startups and best-selling books. As with any tour of duty, overriding circumstances can arise, such as health problems (for example, Paul Allen left Microsoft when he was diagnosed with cancer) or family emergencies. Founders should stay as long as they can; even in later stages, the departure of a founder is always a big deal. When you’re hiring employees, they’re either part of your founding team (and have founder skills or the ability to develop them) or they are probably temporary. But as you grow into the next phase of blitzscaling, hiring will become critical.[LINKEDIN/PAYPAL STORY]"
* At this phase, the role of the CEO is to focus on the product strategy. The startup is trying to exploit a market opportunity. This opportunity might have been created by technological change, a failure on the part of the incumbents to adapt, or by pure inspiration. To exploit that opportunity, the critical strategy is to validate the problem, prove that your solution works, and move as quickly as possible. FOR EXAMPLE… You can take more risk at this phase than later on, because you have so little to lose. Be bold, because the default state of any startup is failure; you have to positively achieve success.
* Frequently, founders are told to focus on building a world-class team. As a result, they seek out experts and specialists. The problem is, specialists tend to be far better suited to mature businesses than startups. In a large company, the organization has the scale to leverage very specific talents, and the stability of the business means that the fact that the narrow focus of a specialist makes him less adaptable to change doesn’t typically matter.In fact, generalists play an important role, even in large companies, but early-stage startups should focus almost entirely on hiring generalists. This doesn’t mean hiring people who lack specific skills or advanced education. “Generalist” isn’t a description of a person’s skills; it’s a description of their capabilities.Hiring generalists means hiring people who can change directions, refactor priorities, learn something new, and adapt quickly to whatever curveballs the universe throws at them, even if they are hired in part for a specific set of skills like developing Android applications. Part of being a generalist means being aware that trying something new inherently implies making mistakes, and having the resilience to recover rapidly and even more important, learn from those mistakes.It’s also usually important to have one or more people who are explicitly generalists. The key is to look for a history of entrepreneurial activity, even if that activity is seemingly irrelevant. For example, our friend John Lilly (current Greylock partner, former CEO of Mozilla) executed a turnaround of an eating club (student-run dining hall) when he was a Stanford undergraduate. You might not need his knowledge of how to evaluate chefs, but his experience demonstrates that he is a self-starter who can figure out how to get something done, even when starting from scratch.A generalist is someone who can do everything from finding a new office to assisting with financing to running partnership negotiations, all the while managing payroll and taking out the trash. A jack of all trades is actually a master of adaptability. At LinkedIn, both Matt Cohler and Lee Hower were early employees that we hired as generalists, who helped us scale rapidly. (Incidentally, both of them are now venture capitalists.) [EXAMPLE: HOW THEY CONTRIBUTED TO BLITZSCALING]When you have 10 or fewer people in the organization, everyone has to be a generalist.Another frequent piece of bad advice for Family-stage startups occurs when well-meaning people tell you to hire employees who can scale with the company. That’s simply wrong. Hiring individual contributors who are great at what they do, but aren’t going to scale into senior roles when the company grows is absolutely fine *if* they’re great at what they do now, what we referred to in our book The Alliance as a Tour of Duty.Your responsibility as a leader and manager is to figure out what their path within the organization is likely to be as it grows so that you can set accurate expectations for the future. Hopefully, you can chart a course that allows the employee to progress in his career, but even if there isn’t a clear path forward, being honest with the employee about your expectations is vital. It’s not that founders intend to make false promises to employees, but a lack of clarity and detail often results in incorrect assumptions about future roles. When those expectations are dashed, the result is usually a messy separation than harms both company and employee. In contrast, if the expectations are clear from the start, the employee can serve an extremely productive tour of duty that benefits both the company and the employee, and afterwards, the employee can be a valued member of the company’s corporate alumni network.Even if you wanted to, you’re not going to be able to hire people for permanent roles. The team you have now won’t all be with you when you have 10,000+ employees. The senior management team you have now won’t be the same that’s around you when you ring the NYSE bell at your IPO. At LinkedIn, only two of the original 10 employees remain at the company, though the others are enthusiastic and supportive alumni (including me!).Moreover, most successful large-company executives are worse than useless at this stage because their instincts pull them in precisely the wrong direction. You don’t want to prematurely hire people who are best-suited to the later stages. As the company grows, you’ll be coaching some current employees to take on bigger roles, bringing in some new people, and regularly reconfiguring the organization.Of course, you need some people who will scale and stick around to provide continuity and institutional memory, serving what we refer to as a Foundational tour of duty. Usually, the founders will fill this role. Just as employees need to have the resilience to accept a certain error rate, the organization needs to accept that not every hire is going to work out. While hiring mistakes are very expensive, and you try to be as certain as possible, you have to presume that you won’t have a 100% hit rate. Not only are you hiring fast, the organization itself is changing so quickly that even someone who is a good fit today may be a bad fit in six months. Don’t be afraid to admit when you’ve made a mistake, or when you need to make a change. If you’ve been honest and open about what the organization needs, and set realistic expectations, you’ll be able to make changes—even painful ones—without de-railing your blitzscaling efforts.At this stage, you’re also starting to establish your culture. As I mentioned, only 2 of the original 10 employees are still at LinkedIn, but the culture that those 10 employees helped build remains in effect. It has evolved of course, but it has stayed on the general track we set up over a decade ago. LinkedIn has a non-hierarchical culture which believes in individual economic empowerment through self-determination. We value technical excellence, but also adhere to Bob Sutton’s “No Asshole Rule.” Some have argued that our culture is too conservative, but this simply illustrates the fact that successful cultures make specific tradeoffs with which others disagree.Culture comes down to how the founders and founding team treat each other, and whom you choose to hire. Live up to your values, and choose wisely, and you’ll build a lasting culture. You’re not bothering to do team-building exercises and trust falls. Leave those for big companies. The startup itself is a trust fall—if the team members don’t have each other’s backs, the startup is doomed to fail. Instead of exercises, what you are doing is spending a bunch of time together—including evenings, weekends, and holidays—solving problems, and the culture will naturally arise from and be reinforced by the ways you interact with each other during that process. 
* At this stage, you should hire people who are comfortable crossing uneven ground in the fog. These people feel a paranoid urgency, have the ability to learn whatever is necessary, and are open to change and pivoting. Like a founder, they are adaptable. Given the small size of the team, it’s also important that they be willing to take on any task, no matter how lacking in prestige, as long as it is important. The best way to find these people is to look for evidence of entrepreneurial spirit in what they’ve done, whether in the business world or elsewhere.Any managers you hire at this point are on Transformational tours of duty (it is hard to make a lifetime commitment to an organization that barely even exists), but no one is thinking about leaving the company unless it fails or they lose faith in its fundamental investment thesis.It’s a mistake to be looking for executive experience; focus on critical skills and talents. Things like product-market fit should be part of the founding team, but other things like design and engineering might be hired in at this point.Don’t hire “resumes”; hiring based on how someone looks on paper is counterproductive. Experience at brand-name companies often doesn’t teach you the right lessons on how to grow a no-name startup. Instead, hire the best athlete available. [PAYPAL OR LINKEDIN EXAMPLE? Sarah Imbach?]The one exception to this prohibition on premature executive hiring is when you’re hiring people you’ve worked with before. You don’t need to guess whether they have startup skills—you know from personal experience. Hiring people whose work you know well is especially useful for enterprise companies, where you generally have a better idea of what skills will be needed to win in the marketplace.Generally, you should be pretty draconian about the character of those you hire and retain. You are setting the company culture during this phase and the next, so you should have a very high bar for these early hires. At LinkedIn, for example, we always tried to follow what Stanford’s Bob Sutton dubbed, “The No-Asshole Rule.” When Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia were looking for Airbnb’s first employee, they spent several months and interviewed hundreds of people before hiring Nick Grandy.That being said, you can’t always be quite so strict on qualifications. The conventional wisdom of Silicon Valley is that you should only hire A players. But when you’re at this phase (i.e. you are an unknown startup without any funding), B+ is often the best you can do. Given all you need to accomplish in a hurry, you can’t afford to wait around for an A. Sometimes the people you hire will surprise you and rise to the occasion, but you also have to be ready to transition in a respectful way. The key to building and maintaining an alliance with these hires is to be honest and to set clear expectations for their specific tour of duty.
* In this stage, onboarding is typically informal and ad hoc. Bringing in a new person is like introducing a new boyfriend or girlfriend; you have the new guy or gal over for a family dinner so that everyone can get to know them. Everyone’s probably a little nervous, but if you’ve chosen well, the rest of the family clicks with the new person, and pretty soon, you’re giving them the keys to the house.This informal process works because the team is still small enough for every member to have a personal relationship with every other member of the team. You’re also so busy, that taking the time to create a formal onboarding process is as remote a possibility as not checking your email after 5 PM.If the family rejects the new member, as painful as it might be, you probably need to move on. The team is so lean that every member has to be a full member of the family. 
* Internal communications are easy when you’re in the Family stage. Almost every member of the team is under the same roof, and may very well be in the same room. When you have a question or need feedback, you can simply stand up from your chair (or balancing ball…or treadmill desk….) and say, “Hey! Does anyone know…?”This “groundhog” communication technique is organic, quick, and effective. Everyone is still working on the same initiative, so the interruption is likely productive (or if necessary, easily ignored by wearing headphones). The biggest challenge you likely face is keeping the rare virtual employee in the loop. Because it is so easy for the rest of the team to communicate with each other, you have to make the effort to constantly communicate with any remote team members to keep them on the same basis as the rest of the team. This is where communications tools like Slack can be so helpful, by providing a medium where all the team members are participating on the same terms, and by allow asynchronous communication, which helps overcome time zone differences. Another approach some companies take is to set up a 24/7 videoconference using tools like Skype or Google Hangouts to simulate being in the same room.At this stage, you probably don’t even have an “All” email alias, since so many email threads already have every employee in the address line! 
* When CEO succession occurs this early, you’re always bringing in a co-founder. For example, when Jerry Yang and Dave Filo hired Tim Koogle to run Yahoo!, they considered him as a co-founder. 
* At this stage, the board is probably just the founders, with perhaps a key advisor. Usually, you shouldn’t lock into a board here, because boards are harder to upgrade than other talent. Here, you actually should wait for “A” players.Your advisors should be founders and venture capitalists; at this stage, the advice of big company executives is almost, but not quite, completely irrelevant. 


Tribe
* The startup is hiring employees beyond its founders, but its founders are still responsible for the success or failure of the business. Even if you’ve hired a few key engineers or salespeople, the founders are still the key decision-makers. When a salesperson meets with a prospect to close the business, a founder should be in the room to provide support (and to learn from the prospect’s feedback).On a day to day basis, every member of the team—including and especially the founders—does just about anything that is required to ship the product and keep it working once it’s in the hands of the customer. Even the specialists are generalists. For example, Paul English, the founder of Kayak, set up the company’s customer service line to ring his personal cell phone.While it is theoretically possible that the company hires an outside CEO at this phase, this is extremely rare, and when it does occur, that outside CEO is joining so early that she is really a co-founder, not a hired hand.
* In the previous phase, you pretty much hired all your employees through your personal network. At this point, however, you’ve run out of smart people you know who are available, even in entrepreneurially rich places like Silicon Valley. Your team may know a ton of great people, but there are so many interesting projects besides yours that most people are already spoken for.Now that you’re growing into tens of employees, you actually need to start setting up real hiring processes. One thing that few startups do (unless they have experienced founders) is to have a rigorous hiring process for people they don’t know. You may think you don’t have time to bother with these niceties, but experienced founders know that it’s useful to put in a little bit of time early on to establish a clear and productive process.Much like the great basketball coach John Wooden began each year by teaching his players how to tie their shoes, you should make sure you clearly lay out the basic steps in the hiring process, including writing a job requisition, sourcing candidates from outside your personal networks, standard interviewing techniques, and reference checking.It’s especially common for startups to underinvest in reference checking. Everyone is in a hurry, and by the time you’ve gotten the team to agree on a particular candidate, you’re both running out of time, and dreading the possibility of having to go back to the start with a new set of candidates. Don’t get lazy. If I had to pick between conducting an interview and conducting a reference check, I’d pick the reference check. After all, the reference has known the candidate for years, and has seen how he behaves under extreme pressure; you’ve met the candidate for 30 minutes, and have seen how he writes on a whiteboard.Make sure that you establish clear process guidelines. At Google, hiring managers would go overboard, sending some candidates to interview with more than a dozen people. Then Google analyzed the data, and discovered that four interviews was enough to achieve an 85% success rate in judging candidates; additional interviews increased the success rate, but by only about 1% per interview. Google ended up establishing a five interview limit. (Five was judged to be a) conservative, and b) a prime number, and thus appealing to computer scientists.)To really get an edge in terms of recruiting, hire a full-time recruiting lead to establish and enforce your process. If hiring is that important, it deserves to be someone’s full-time focus. The recruiting lead isn’t just an administrator; he or she also has to help the organization develop a talent brand. If you’re a consumer company and you’re lucky, you may have a “cool” product that attracts people who want to work on it. It’s more likely, however, that you don’t have the time to wait for your talent brand to develop organically. This effort needs to involve all the different parts of the organization: Engineering should contribute to open source projects, Marketing should try to snag conference speaking engagements and press coverage, and so on. 
* You typically don’t make a change in the transition from Household to Tribe because the demands of management don’t change that much. But as you shift from being a Tribe to a Village, and during any later shifts, CEO succession becomes something you need to consider.The Tribe/Village transition is actually one of the best times to bring in a CEO; you’re about to massively scale up the company, and you can then build the company around the CEO. For LinkedIn, we brought in Dan Nye at about 40-50 employees. Dan was and is an excellent executive, and helped us grow LinkedIn from a small organization into a real company.
* At this stage, the startup has likely raised money, which means that the board will consist of the founders and one or two investors. The board should have three to seven members, preferably towards the lower end. The company’s main challenge is to get the product to market so it can prove that it has a valuable, scalable business. Therefore, the key criteria for selecting board members is whether or not they have relevant skills (product, sales, marketing, etc.) to help the company get the product to market.You probably don’t have independent board members. The issue is that for most independent board members, your company isn’t a full-time job. For venture capitalists, growing startups is their full-time job. At modern venture capital firms, the general partners tend to have been successful founders and executives, not financiers. Because they’ve done it before, they can help you scale the blitzscaling ladder.There are exceptions of course; if you have a really high-quality independent board member who brings a great network, and has great relationships with the founders and investors, that can be a huge value-add. Having a “brand” isn’t enough to justify inclusion; the board needs to be a working board (and you can always add a “celebrity” board member at a later phase if that becomes important).Ideally, you’re in touch with your investors every week (you can’t move quickly enough if you wait for monthly board meetings), and make sure they have a map in their head of the challenges facing the company and what needs to happen to address them.Since you don’t have much to defend, the focus needs to be on playing offense. As we’ve noted, the default result of a startup is failure; success is like throwing yourself off a cliff and successfully assembling an airplane on the way down. It sure helps to have board members who can help build the wings and propellers.Corporate governance is largely a secondary consideration, but the board still has to pay attention to key questions like, “How much cash is in the bank?” and “What are the long-term obligations we’re assuming?”
* At this stage, it’s still possible for every employee to know each other, and to have a sense of what each person is working on. Yet the number of communication pairs is so great that you have to start instituting formal communications processes, like all-hands meetings. Even at 20 or 30 employees, it’s possible to hold a daily standup meeting to share information and ask the team for answers or help. As the company grows into the upper reaches of this stage, even those meetings become unwieldy, and it may be necessary to leverage online tools like wikis or project management software to give employees a more scalable way to see what a particular other employee is working on. The leaders of the company should also start using a formal “push” communications channel to inform the rest of the company about key issues and decisions, such as holding a weekly company meeting where the CEO and/or department heads give formal presentations.
* As the company grows, it becomes impossible to have every employee interview every candidate. Even if you magically had the time available, putting candidates through such an arduous process would drive away nearly everyone you wanted to hire. As a result, individual managers and groups within the company are probably hiring people without a lot of cross-checking. This makes onboarding more of a challenge, since you’re now introducing someone that is a virtual stranger to the rest of the tribe.One solution is to be willing to fire people quickly if they don’t gel with the rest of the team. Some companies adopt this approach because it allows them to save time on the recruiting and onboarding processes. But this kind of approach has significant implications for the kind of culture the organization can have. Quick-to-hire, quick-to-fire might work fine for a hard-driving, individualistic culture, but it would rapidly destroy a culture that emphasized teamwork and collaboration. Most organizations are better off hiring carefully and onboarding candidates thoughtfully.The hiring manager needs to take charge of the onboarding process, even if it is informal. That manager should educate the new hire on how the company works, and make introductions to key people to jumpstart the relationships that will become necessary later on.

* At this stage, you should hire people who can lead small- and medium-sized teams, but are also doers. The organization is still too small to support managers who don’t also serve as important individual contributors.When you hire a manager at this phase, it’s more like hiring another co-founder than a professional manager. If the manager isn’t a co-founder, he or she is directly supporting a founder.Given the size, stage, and fragility of the organization, managers need a damn good reason to leave. In the language of our previous book, “The Alliance,” managers have committed to a tour of duty. Breaking that tour of duty is tells you something about their essential character and is definitely a black mark on their record.During the latter portions of this stage, you have probably hired people who are really good managers, but you probably haven’t hired an executive yet.


Village
* As the organization grows, the founding team needs to start differentiating their individual roles. Up to this point, you may have had a team of equals. Even if one founder had the title of CEO, the key decisions may still be made as a founding team.Now, the organization has to have a clear CEO (we’ll discuss the role of the CEO in depth in the next chapter). As a team, you have to decide whether to hire an outside CEO, or designate one of the founders as the undisputed CEO. This isn’t about phasing out the other founders—they remain important—rather, it is about providing organizational clarity. This is also why it is almost always a bad idea to name co-CEOs. How can you have organizational clarity when you have two final decision makers? There are, of course, notable exceptions. Our friend and colleague Aneel Bhusri has been very successful at Workday, where he and Dave Duffield are co-CEOs. They are able to make the arrangement work since they have been working together since 1993!Even after you choose or hire a CEO, the founders should retain special founder’s privileges. For example, as owners of the business, founders have a right to ask for the CEO’s time to discuss strategy and key decisions. Founders should have the right to express disagreement (one on one). This is one of the reasons being an outside CEO can be a frustrating role! Even if the founders don’t have a lot of people reporting to them, they still need to be “in the room” for important company decisions.What the founders are not allowed to do is to undermine the CEO or create dissention (versus dissent, which is usually healthy and constructive). Once she makes a decision, the founders should back her and do their best to drive that decision forward.Founders are still a part of the Executive Team, and work with the hired executives as peers, even if the founder reports to that executive in the hierarchy. It’s not always easy to context-switch between the two roles of peer and subordinate, but founders can do so because of their dual roles. Most founders are both a founder and something else: Founder & CEO; Founder & Executive; Founder & Manager; Founder & Individual Contributor. For the sake of the organization, founders need to make it clear which context applies when they are interacting with the other members of the organization. [EXAMPLE; PROVIDE A QUOTE OR SAMPLE COMMUNICATION]If you’re a non-CEO founder, your role is to focus on doing whatever the organization most needs to succeed. This might involve leading a functional area such as Sales or Engineering. It might involve being an external spokesperson for the company. You might work on being a good partner to the CEO. The exact role can vary because you’re the long-term committed person who doesn’t just treat your work as a job. This long-term perspective allows founders to do hard things that involve short-term pain to maximize the long-term gains to the organization.Besides functional roles, founders also serve as catalysts and culture bearers. Employees, investors, and customers know that they can count on founders to put the company first. A founder thinks, “I win because the company wins.”
* Establish a department? Incentivize participation in the hiring process?You’re starting to shift from primarily hiring generalists to primarily hiring specialized talents. Unless you’re massively successful, a lot of the generalists who joined you earlier because they love startups might be looking to transition elsewhere. The new people who come in are more interested in stability than crossing uneven ground in the fog. Hiring gets harder because you can’t offer the startup experience (small size, intimate relationships, impact on the entire organization). But, there is another population of people who are looking for high-growth, Village-stage companies. These are folks who are trying to catch a rocket ship after it’s left the launchpad. But many blitzscaling companies don’t have that visible evidence of liftoff, yet still need to hire quickly.Your organization is in a “trough” because you’re not big enough to offer the perks of a big company like corporate universities and so on, but you’re too big to feel like a two-pizza startup.To work your way through this trough, you now need to establish a hiring or recruiting department, complete with an executive to lead it, whether a Head of Recruiting or Chief Talent Officer. This is the only way to handle the increased pace and burden of hiring during this stage. If you haven’t already, you should also institute formal hiring bonuses for referring candidates. Really ahead-of-the-curve companies extend these referral bonus programs to former employees as well as current ones; tapping your corporate alumni base for candidate referrals can be a great source of high-quality people.
* This is the stage where your startup starts to break through and become a scaleup. To manage this growth, you need executives. But hiring executives triggers a cascade of consequences.First, you will probably have to hire from outside your company; the internal pool is simply too small, and too heavily weighted towards individual contributors. It’s still preferable to promote from within, but the benefit of doing so is by far a secondary concern in comparison to the primary objective of hiring executives with the requisite people skills.As you hire in your key executives, most of the managers who reported directly to the founders will find themselves reporting to newcomers. Hopefully you’ve done a good job of managing their expectations; even if you have, make sure that you ask yourself, “Am I doing what’s necessary to keep them engaged?” Every person should have a clear tour of duty: they should know their mission, what constitutes success, how that success helps the company, and how that success helps their career.Second, you will have to reorganize the company. To effectively leverage your managers, you need to be able to give each of them their own sandbox—a separable unit and task so that they can create a coherent and efficient work plan for their project. These sandboxes can and will change a lot as the company learns from being in the market. Don’t let people get too attached to job titles which might be obsolete in less than three months.These reorganizations will probably require one or more of the founders to report to a newly hired executive, which triggers the need for the founders to define their roles going forward. Almost universally, one of the challenges that founders have is that because they are good at starting companies, they are highly unlikely to be good at the very different activities involved in massive scale.Finally, just as you have to take into consideration the scalability of your founders and current employees, you also have to think about the scalability of the executives you’re hiring. Remember that you’re probably going to have to turn over at least 50% of your executive team before you reach the next stage of Organizational Scale. When executives are really good at a particular stage of blitzscaling, it’s often because their skills are tuned to the needs of that particular stage. One way to help scale up your executives is to supplement them with great supporting players, such as a Chief of Staff or key lieutenant. (See sidebar below)Given the size of the company, it also becomes more important to hire strong communicators. One-on-one relationships aren’t enough at this stage; your key leaders need to be able to address large groups and inspire them to action.You don’t have to hire a complete executive suite. You have to cover all the major functions (Sales, Marketing, Business Development, Product, Engineering, and Finance) but is usually the case that only one or two of the functions are truly critical path. These are the functions you should emphasize in your hiring, both in terms of quality and quantity. If a function isn’t critical path, you may be able to have a single executive cover multiple functions.Sidebar: Chief of StaffHistorically, the Chief of Staff position hasn’t been that common in blitzscaling companies, but this seems to be changing. A Chief of Staff differs from a COO or President because he or she doesn’t have a direct managerial relationship with line executives and managers. This is actually the point of the Chief of Staff; rather than serving as an intermediary between you and your reports, the Chief of Staff serves as a collaborator and organizer that helps the CEO or executive personally scale to execute across multiple problem sets and domains. The Chief of Staff could be a young, high-potential talent or an experienced executive. Intel’s Technical Assistant program is an example of the former, while the non-commissioned officers (NCOs) of the US military are an example of the latter. [WHAT SHOULD YOU LOOK FOR, AND WHY CHOOSE YOUNG VS EXPERIENCED?]. I hired an early Chief of Staff at LinkedIn, and he allowed me to be much higher leverage within the organization. [ADD SPECIFICS OF WHAT MATT COHLER ACTUALLY DID]. 
* At this stage, the pace of hiring is such that you have to develop a formalized onboarding process. Common features include an actual employee manual that lays out what a new hire needs to know, and whom to talk with about various issues.This more formal onboarding may include specific techniques like having the new hire shadow an experienced employee to learn the ropes, and giving new hires (especially engineers) their own sandbox where they can try out (and if necessary, fail at) their new role and function. 
* Once the organization passes Dunbar’s number, and is likely split into multiple buildings or even cities, push communications become the default way of keeping people on the same page. In addition to an “All” email alias, you probably also have aliases for each office, and each department. However, at this point, the company has so many simultaneous initiatives and projects, it’s impossible to keep every employee on the same page for everything. You have to focus on the most important items which affect nearly the entire organization.The primary communication channel for founders and executives is the formal company all-hands, which might now include live video broadcasting to loop in other offices. The all-hands also needs to have a formal questions period so that employees can request needed details and feel part of the decision-making process. The company all-hands is highly scalable; even today, LinkedIn conducts regular all-hands meetings, with the video beamed to offices outside Mountain View, and moderators in each office to gather questions for management.You’re probably also beginning to introduce some “pull” communications tools like formal FAQs—e.g. here’s how we use this tool, here’s how we handle security, here’s the expense report policy—to handle routine information requests.Given the size of the company and the increasingly important role it plays in your industry, you’re likely introducing making more of the company’s sensitive information secret. You’re probably not sharing the bank balance with all employees, or keeping people up to speed on the twists and turns of the latest fundraising effort. Some more secretive cultures might make this move earlier, but as the company gets closer to being a publicly-traded company, even the most open cultures have to make moves in this direction. 
* The Village/City transition is another key shift, which means that it is also a good time to bring in a CEO. At LinkedIn, we brought in Jeff Weiner when we had around 400 employees, and he’s since scaled the company to nearly 10,000 employees. 
* At this stage, the board of directors needs to make corporate governance a primary emphasis. While board members can help with the product with their skills, industry knowledge, and connections, their main job is to hire, fire, and compensate the CEO.The board might support one of the founders as CEO. The natural tension here is that the founder might think that building the company to this point makes her the natural choice for CEO, while the investors are focused on picking a CEO who can lead the company to its next phase. The board will have to evaluate the founder CEO candidate; if it doesn’t think the founder is the right person, it needs to generate and implement an action plan to bring the right person in.The key evaluation question is, “Is this candidate capable of blitzscaling this company to its next phase?” This can be broken down into “Which aspects of the company are on the critical path for scaling?” and “Is this candidate solid on these critical path aspects?” Trying to get every aspect of the company ready for scaling is a suboptimal ploy—the board has to focus exclusively on what really matters.A complicating factor is that the company may have raised multiple rounds of financing, which means the board has to take into consideration the needs of many stakeholders. The best way to handle this is to bring in truly independent board members. These “independents” can be a trusted catalyst to mediate the conflicting interests of investors, founders, and employees.It’s hard to find a good independent board members. Things like “brand” and attractiveness on an IPO prospectus are way down the wish list; the top item is the ability to contribute to an effective board, followed by the ability to work well with the CEO and executive team to scale the company. 


City
* In the 1990s, British anthropologist Robin Dunbar postulated that the human brain’s cognitive limits keep us from maintaining stable social relationships with more than around 150 people. This is known as Dunbar’s Number. During the first three phases of Organizational Scale, it is possible for an individual member of the organization to know all the other members of the organization. But once a company reaches OS4, you can’t rely on people relationships to govern and manage the organization. Clear rules and boundaries become critical.Breaking through Dunbar’s number also changes the experience of being a founder. You might find yourself thinking that things don’t “feel” like they used to during the good old days. You don’t know all the people you run into when you prowl through the office. These changes often lead to some of the founders leaving the organization.The founders who choose to stay may see their roles evolve further. Some founders will have the skills to work at and remain part of the core executive team. Founders who lack the seniority and experience to do so might serve as line executives who manage individual teams, or even as individual contributors. The organization might create a special role for a founder who is valuable, but isn’t well-suited for management, such as working towards the long-term future, special projects, or acting as a company spokesperson. [PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE, SUCH AS HOW REID SPENDS HIS DAY AT LINKEDIN]At LinkedIn, I removed myself from line management during the OS4 phase. As a founder, I wanted to build the greatest possible strengths in the organization, so I hired Jeff Weiner when the company had around 400 employees. I wasn’t passionate about being a line executive; Jeff is passionate about running an organization, which allows him to be world class in that role (in a way that I couldn’t).
* At this stage, you’re probably going to start breaking the organization up into business units. A general manager can probably handle up to eight direct reports. Those direct reports can each handle another eight reports themselves, and those reports can manage the frontline employees. This rule of thumb limits groups to roughly 400 to 800 employees. 
* At this scale, onboarding has to go from simply being formalized to being truly industrialized. You’re now hiring so many people that individual manual onboarding can’t handle the load. Some of the techniques to try include onboarding people in “classes” so that onboarding becomes one-to-many rather than just one-to-one, as well as automating large chunks of the onboarding process by creating welcome videos and other interactive training for new employees. It was during this phase, for example, that the HR team at LinkedIn developed our online training platform, LearnIn, to help onboard new employees and help current employees stay up to date on the latest developments at the company.
* At the City stage, your organization is definitely spread across multiple offices, and probably across multiple time zones and even continents. Not only is it impossible for a single employee to know all the other employees of the company, it’s highly improbable they even know all the other employees in their office. WHAT IS A HYPERCUBE NETWORK?The information that the founders and leaders broadcast is, perforce, restricted to high-level information, with more detailed information broadcast by department heads, general managers, and regional leaders.Given the scale of the company, having a good company directory with powerful search capabilities becomes very important. While I’m glad that many companies seem to rely on LinkedIn to meet this need, the fact is that a publicly-accessible social network doesn’t allow you to discover which employees are involved with critical initiatives. You need to productize communication so that employees use scalable internal tools, and not unscalable people to find out what they need to know.For example, what processes do you put in place around investing in other companies? This is especially relevant if your company is publicly traded. Whereas before, you might have told managers to ask Joe from Legal, you probably need a formal conflict resolution process with actual forms and structured data.If you hadn’t already begun to restrict usage of the “All” email alias at the previous stage, you definitely do it here! “All” becomes a pure broadcast tool without the ability to reply-all. 
* Even if you plan on being CEO into your 70s, you have to have a succession plan so that your company can live on after you’re gone. Life is also terribly uncertain; it’s irresponsible not to have a succession plan. You owe it to your employees, to the world around you, and to the impact on the world you’ve wanted to have). 
* At this stage, the company should start bringing in board members who look good on the IPO prospectus. Note that this is mostly, but not perfectly correlated with the ability to help the company be successful in the long term. Yet even though the board member’s brand matters, competency matters more. The board is still a team, not a collection of all-stars. For that matter, a person who wants to be on your board to enhance their own brand is not someone you want; they will be risk-averse.If you don’t have independent board members yet, you’re well past due. In fact, you need more than one. One of the requirements of going public is being able the handle the requirements of a diversified shareholder base.The board members still have to perform the vital governance role of evaluating the CEO and executive team. The best way to do this is for each key executive to be “owned” by a board member, who will develop a closer working relationship with that executive. These relationships are essential for evaluating the CEO and her potential successors. The art is developing these relationships without undermining the CEO. The board members should have the competence to talk with executives without introducing problems. That means avoiding damaging questions like "So, what is the CEO's greatest weakness," in favor of something like "What do you see as the greatest challenges and opportunities facing the company?" This also provides the board member with a window into the thought processes of the executive.Finally, given the success the company has achieved to date, the board has a responsibility to preserve asset value. This means playing defense as well as offense. This is another reason why the board members that were suitable for an earlier stage might not be at this stage. 


Nation
* When your rag-tag tribe has become a massive nation, it takes on a life and momentum of its own. During the early days, the challenge as a founder was figuring out how to maneuver a small organization through a dizzying obstacle course of challenges. Because the organization was nimble and responsive, you could steer a very aggressive and active course. But when you’re leading a nation, you need to be more thoughtful.A nation isn’t a single homogenous group; it’s a federation of many different groups and teams. Often, a scaleup that reaches this stage will have international operations that are geographically and hierarchically separate.At this scale, the key skill a founder needs is the ability to productively integrate with the rest of the organization. Unless you’re the CEO, you can’t just change the direction of the organization by fiat. This collaborative role increases the relative value of soft skills like influencing others, asking good questions, and contributing to broader discussions.At LinkedIn, for example, I try to spend enough time with the executive team so that when challenges arise, I can help influence and contribute to the process of meeting those challenges.
* At this stage, your executives need to be leaders, not just managers. They need to be able to run their own organizations which may very well be as large as entire companies at earlier stages of Organizational Scale. The CEO needs to place a great deal of trust in these leaders because she is now four or more levels of hierarchy distant from the frontline employees, and will have a hard time gathering bottom-up data and feedback. 
* At the highest levels of scale, companies need to shift from a single “assembly line” for onboarding to multiple parallel processes. Different geographies and different departments will need their own localized onboarding tools and processes, and one of the biggest challenges will be balancing local customization with maintain an overall feeling of being part of a cohesive community.ASK PEOPLE AT PAYPAL, LINKEDIN ABOUT THIS.

* By this point, you are siloing most of the company’s information and communications, possibly for secrecy or regulatory reasons, but mostly just to reduce confusion. Simply reading every update email would be more than a full-time job! Communications are largely handled at the regional, business unit, and departmental level, with only the most important items reserved for all-hands communications. 
* When a company of this scale undertakes a CEO succession, it is often an integral part of a larger initiative to change the game the company is playing. Success imprints more strongly than failure, and a long period of success tends to inhibit change. Most CEOs who have been super-successful at one particular game have a hard time changing their game. At Microsoft, Steve Ballmer’s sales-oriented approach was so successful for so long that the company had a hard time shifting from packaged software to the cloud. Naming Satya Nadella CEO placed an experienced cloud executive at Microsoft’s helm, and sent a clear signal—internally and externally—that Microsoft was serious about the cloud. A generation earlier, IBM turned to Lou Gerstner to help shift the company’s focus from computers to services. When you realize your company has to change the game it’s playing, you need to consider whether you’re the best person to lead the team in a new direction. One of the amazing things about Mark Zuckerberg as a CEO has been his ability to master multiple games. Zuckerberg (with the assistance of Sheryl Sandberg and an able executive team) has been able to shift Facebook from a desktop website to a native mobile application, and from a company that focused on building everything internally to a company that makes bold, game-changing acquisitions like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus VR. 
* At this stage, the primary concerns of the board should be CEO succession and risk management. Remember, risk management isn’t solely about risk reduction; sometimes the right play is to assume intelligent risk, such as a major investment in a potential breakthrough product.The board will continue to serve as a key advisor to the CEO, especially during moments of crisis or challenge.
